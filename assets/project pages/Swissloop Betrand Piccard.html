          <h4 class="h4">Project Overview</h4>
          <p>
            “Bertrand Piccard” is Swissloop’s 2023 Hyperloop prototype, designed and built by a multidisciplinary team of 38 students. The pod is named after the renowned Swiss explorer and environmentalist, reflecting the team’s commitment to innovation and sustainability. The project focused on advancing Hyperloop technology, with a particular emphasis on LSRM propulsion, complete lateral and vertical levitation, and vacuum compatibility. The pod competed at the European Hyperloop Week 2023 in Edinburgh, where it won five awards for its technical achievements including the "Complete Systems Award" crowning it as the winner of the competition.

            I was leading this interdisciplinary team as a full-time project lead throughout the season. I was responsible for the timeline, budget, hiring, press, CI, supervision Bachelor Theses and the overall project management.

          <h4 class="h4">The Hyperloop Concept</h4>
          <p>
            The concept of travelling through tubes with hardly any air in it, thus reducing the aerodynamic drag and enabling travel at high speeds, has been around since the early 19th century. Today, the Hyperloop concept usually refers to a well-known white paper published in 2013 by Elon Musk in collaboration with a joint team from Tesla and SpaceX. Said paper suggests that transport “pods” gradually accelerate using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on air bearings through near-evacuated tubes below or above the ground. This should allow the pods to travel at speeds of up to 1’200km/h, whilst being more energy-efficient, quiet and autonomous than other modes of transportation. Thus, the Hyperloop concept has the potential of optimizing long-distance travel by combining the efficacy of modern-day railway systems with the speed of air travel.

          <h4 class="h4">What is Swissloop?</h4>
          <p>
            Swissloop is a student-led initiative with the goal of contributing to the research on and advancement of the Hyperloop technology and its application in the real world. To do our part in shaping this new mode of transportation, our team designs and builds operational prototypes of transport capsules — so-called “pods” — with which we compete in international competitions and take part in conferences. In partaking in this event, we aim to not just add to the further development of this technology, but also collect valuable practical experience in the technical and operational aspects of the project. In addition, we want to help raise public awareness of the Hyperloop concept it’s, and its implications for our everyday life and its impact on the future of transportation and mobility technology.
