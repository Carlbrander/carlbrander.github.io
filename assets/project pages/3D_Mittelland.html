          <p>
            After the start of the pandemic, I started to explore the world of 3D printing more seriously.
            To finance my hobby, I started a small-scale 3D printing service called "3D-Mittelland".
            I offered my services online and through local channels, providing custom 3D printing solutions to clients.
            The service was well-received, and I managed to build a small client base all over Switzerland.
            The project not only allowed me to improve my 3D printing skills but also taught me valuable lessons in customer service, project management, and entrepreneurship. 
            I learned how to manage client expectations, handle logistics, and deliver high-quality products on time.
            The experience was incredibly rewarding, and it sparked my interest in exploring more complex 3D printing projects in the future (such as Swissloop).

          <ul>
              <p>
                Due to the success of the service, I decided to expand my offerings to include different 3D printing technologies.
                I invested in a resin printer to provide high-resolution prints for clients who needed micrometer-level detailed prototypes or models.
                This allowed me to cater to a wider range of clients.
                The resin printer opened up new possibilities for intricate designs and complex geometries that were not possible with FDM printing.

          <h4 class="h4">Extending to exotic materials</h4>
          <p>
            As the service grew, I started experimenting with exotic materials such as wood-filled PLA, carbon fiber reinforced filaments, and even glow-in-the-dark materials.
            These materials allowed me to create stronger and more unique parts, which were well-received by clients looking for specialized applications.
            The use of these advanced materials set my service apart from competitors and attracted more clients looking for unique 3D printed parts.
            I also started offering post-processing services such as sanding, painting, and assembly to provide a complete solution for clients.

            <p>
              I established a small social media following to showcase my 3D printing projects and engage with potential clients.
              Platforms like Instagram and my website became valuable tools for sharing my work, connecting with existing customers, and attracting new customers.
              I regularly posted updates on ongoing projects, behind-the-scenes content, and finished prints to keep my audience engaged.
              This approach helped me build a community around my work and foster relationships with clients.
              I also encouraged user-generated content by asking satisfied customers to share photos of their prints, which further increased engagement and visibility.

          <ul>
            <p>
              After a successful run, I decided to close the service in 2022 to focus on my studies and other projects such as my involvement at Swissloop which was very time-intensive.
              The experience of running 3D-Mittelland was invaluable, providing me with practical skills in entrepreneurship, customer service, and technical expertise in 3D printing.
              I learned how to manage a small business, handle client relationships, and deliver high-quality products.
              The project not only fueled my passion for 3D printing but also laid the foundation for future endeavors in the field.
