          <p>
            As one of my largest personal project commitments, I am working towards adapting my family home to a fully
            self-sufficient and sustainable PV-powered smart home.
            This includes large-scale PV generation, battery storage, smart EV charging, control of heatpump heating and heatpump boiler
            all connected through open-source home-assistant for load balancing.
            The project utilizes self-developed AI solar-power prediction up to a week in advance using self-collected data and current weather forecasts.
            Everything is visualized through a large kitchen dashboard screen and controlled by various IoT microcontrollers around the house.
            This enables maximization of self-sufficiency which optimizes ROI of the installed hardware and reduces dependency on the grid.

          <ul>
              <p>
                As seen on the image, the biggest time-sink is compatibility issues with the various different brands working together in unity.
                This requires tediously reading documentations, and utilizing any possible ways to trick locked-off ecosystems to still be controllable
                from a common interface. Often this is done through reverse-engineering APIs, Modbus TCP, analog logic or even physical button-pressers, induction sensors or 
                servos.<br>
                All hardware elements either posess a smart-interface or are turned smart by adding ESP32 microcontrollers running EspHome.
                They then all feed into a central home-assistant instance over LAN to control priorities and visualize it on dashboards.

          <h4 class="h4">Control</h4>
          <p>
            The system utilizes three key ingredients to decide on what power consumer to power.
            First, it can be controlled through the home-assistant companion phone app using a self-designed interface.
            This lets users change priorities and enable consumers as they wish.
            Next, a simple algorithmic priority scheduler help balance the load for maximum self-consumption and minimal grid feed-in.
            Lastly, a self-developed NN trained on the past years of our own solar and weather data predicts current and future PV production
            helping both the scheduler and the user make smarter decisions.
            The home-assistant instance is the central point for both input and output of commands and real-time data
            handling scheduling. Ofcourse, everything is backed-up by the inverters own scheduling in case of a power-outage or system failure.

          <ul>
            <p>
              The implementation of this rather complicated net of diverse hardware from various brands, all inter-connected
              with a central control unit brings plenty of benefits.<br>
              While the only control many PV owners have over their setup is seeing their quater-yearly energy bill being lower, 
              they lack any knowledge about areas to improve their self-consumption and therefore their ROI. This leaves not only a  lot of
              money on the table but also reduces the environmental benefit of their PV setup.
              <br>
              This project enables precise monitoring and manual/automated control of consumers optimizing
              self-consumption percentage from 35% to 55% within 4 years while it eliminates dependency on the grid completely
              during summer.

          <ul>
            <p>
            Future directions include moving to a high-availability multi-server system to guarantee control in any curcumstance.
            I also want to increase sampling rate of all sensors to tighten the control loop.
            Furthermore, one can continuously add more power-hungry household devices into the control to improve the self-sufficiency.<br>
            I am also thinking about the possibility of utilizing bitcoin miners in a variable-load setup to consume surplus energy for a profit
            while simultaneously pre-heating essentials such as hot water boilers or the turtle shelter during winter.
