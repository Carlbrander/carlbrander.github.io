          <p>
            This project page is a summary of the main features and automations running in my flat in Zurich.
            It showcases how well a smart-home can be inter-connected if 100+ devices from various manufacturers work in sync.
            Timewise, this project has consumed by far most of my free-time in the past years. But in return, it showcases 
            a futuristic smart-home state which wont be seen in households within the next 20+ years.

                The smart-home is controlled by a local Home Assistant server running on Proxmox. Other essential networking hardware 
                required is a Unifi Cloud Gateway Ultra and a U6 Access Point for internet/Wifi connectivity. The Second network mode 
                is Zigbee which runs over a Zigbee-PoE coordinator, it is used to communicate to the various battery-powered devices.
                Third, a Bluetooth dongle ensures the connectivity for Bluetooth-based devices around the home. 
                While Zigbee utilizes a mesh-based network natively, the Bluetooth connectivity is guaranteed through a handfull of EspHome
                endpoints which act as Bluetooth proxies converting bluetooth signals to wifi around their location.
                On the endpoint side about a dozen ESPHome (ESP32 Microcontroller based sensors) as well as many 3rd party smart devices
                are connected through these endpoints.

            Home Assistant OS is the main software platform running the smart-home as the central hub. It integrates 44+ integrations (each representing a different manufacturer integrating their devices/APIs into Home Assistant).
            These integrations are used to connect the 260+ devices with 1300+ entities (each representing a different sensor/actuator/measurement) in the smart-home.
            This central hub is also used to host addons such as local wakeword detection for voice control, Zigbee and MQTT brokers, and music streaming synchronization services.
            The main automations are written in YAML with Python scripts used for more complex tasks.
            Multiple dashboards are used to visualize the data and control the smart-home. One of them is further described in the smart mirror project. 
            Other dashboards include phone and notebook optimized versions for on-the-go control.
            The entire system is designed to be modular and easily extendable, allowing for new devices and automations to be added as needed.
            The Home Assistant OS runs on a Proxmox VM in parallel to other non-related services.

            <p>
              Out of the dozens of automations constantly running, checking sensor states and triggering actions, here are some of the highlights:
              <ul>
                <li>Automated, dimmed lighting control in most rooms, based on occupancy and natural light levels.</li>
                <li>CO2 monitoring and warning system to ensure healthy air quality.</li>
                <li>Window sensors for open/close detection, especially when leaving the place.</li>
                <li>Integration with weather forecasts to inform and optimize manual heat management.</li>
                <li>Automated house state (asleep, awake, away) detection and putting all devices into off mode when not needed.</li>
                <li>Local voice control in most rooms with a local first, OpenAI LLM second pipeline for a balance between privacy and functionality.</li>
                <li>Scene setups for different activities (e.g., movie night, cooking, sleeping) that adjust lighting, temperature, and media playback.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple light sources per room into "master lights" for simple control.</li>
