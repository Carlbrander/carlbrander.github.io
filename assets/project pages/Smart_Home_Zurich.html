          <p>
            This project page is a summary of the main features and automations running in my flat in Zurich.
            It showcases how well a smart-home can be inter-connected if 100+ devices from various manufacturers work in sync.
            This project has consumed by far most of my free-time in the past years. But in return, it showcases 
            a futuristic smart-home which likely won't be seen in households within the next 20+ years.

                The smart-home is controlled by a local Home Assistant server running on Proxmox. Other essential networking hardware 
                required is a Unifi Cloud Gateway Ultra and a U6 Access Point for internet/Wifi connectivity. The Second network mode 
                is Zigbee which runs over a Zigbee-PoE coordinator, it is used to communicate to the various battery-powered devices.
                Third, a Bluetooth dongle ensures the connectivity for Bluetooth-based devices around the home. 
                While Zigbee utilizes a mesh-based network natively, the Bluetooth connectivity is guaranteed through a handful of ESPHome
                endpoints which act as Bluetooth proxies converting Bluetooth signals to wifi around their location.
                On the endpoint side about a dozen custom ESPHome (ESP32 Microcontroller based) sensors as well as many 3rd party smart devices
                are connected through these endpoints.

            Home Assistant OS is the main software platform running the smart-home as the central hub. It integrates 44+ integrations (each representing a different manufacturer integrating their devices/APIs into Home Assistant).
            These integrations are used to connect the 260+ devices with 1300+ entities (each representing a different sensor/actuator/measurement) in the smart-home.
            This central hub is also used to host addons such as local wakeword detection for voice control, Zigbee and MQTT brokers, and music streaming synchronization services.
            The main automations are written in YAML with Python scripts used for more complex tasks.
            Multiple dashboards are used to visualize the data and control the smart-home. One of them is further described in the smart mirror project. 
            Other dashboards include phone and notebook optimized versions for on-the-go control.
            The entire system is designed to be modular and easily extendable, allowing for new devices and automations to be added as needed.
            The Home Assistant OS runs on a Proxmox VM in parallel to other non-related self-hosted services.

          <ul>
            <p>
              Out of the dozens of automations constantly running, checking sensor states and triggering actions, here are some of the highlights:
              <ul>
                <li>Automated, dimmed lighting control in most rooms, based on occupancy and natural light levels.</li>
                <li>CO2 monitoring and warning system to ensure healthy air quality.</li>
                <li>Window sensors for open/close detection, especially when leaving the place.</li>
                <li>Integration with weather forecasts to inform and optimize manual heat management.</li>
                <li>Automated house state (asleep, awake, away) detection and putting all devices into off mode when not needed.</li>
                <li>Local voice control in most rooms with a local first, OpenAI LLM second pipeline for a balance between privacy and functionality.</li>
                <li>Scene setups for different activities (e.g., movie night, cooking, sleeping) that adjust lighting, temperature, and media playback.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple light sources per room into "master lights" for simple control.</li>
                
              </ul>

          <h4 class="h4">Quality of Life improvement</h4>
          <ul>
            <p>
            It would be a lie to say the overall time spent on this project has been worth it purely from a quality of life perspective.
            The initial setup and constant maintenance require a lot of time and effort. However, the convenience and comfort provided by the smart-home automations are undeniable.
            In the past years, I have observed a steady increase in usability of smart-home software to a point where full no-code solutions
            can build elaborate smart-homes.
            The biggest quality of life improvement is the lighting control, which automatically adjusts based on occupancy and natural light levels.
            Other automations such as CO2 monitoring and house state detection also contribute to a more comfortable living environment.
            Another key apsect is having a "Home App" to control every aspect of your place. This is a true game-changer.
            For anyone that drives a car with a truely well-made phone integration such as a Tesla, this is a similar experience.
            This does not only increase the usability, but also gives a sense of security and peace-of-mind when leaving the place.

          <ul>
            <p>
            Overall, this smart-home project has been a rewarding experience, showcasing the potential of modern smart-home technology.
            While still growing day-by-day and far from perfect, it provides a glimpse into the future of home living.
            The ability to control any smart device, or make any "dumb device" smart, as well as connecting devices from various manufacturers into a
            connected communication network is truly unique.
            I am excited to see the true value-era of IoT after the initial hype has settled down. Where privacy, security and true usability are the main focus points.
            Everyone will be using their local LLM powered home assistants to control every aspect of their lives. And it will feel natural and intuitive.

          <ul>
            <p>
            As this project is still ongoing, there are many future additions planned.
            Some of the key additions include:
              <ul>
                <li>Adding more mm-wave radar based occupancy sensors to build an occupancy state network of the home</li>
                <li>Integrating a highly novel local LLM-based system for automatic context-aware home control</li>
                <li>Expanding the server infrastructure to handle streaming, gaming, sharing and more. No need for Desktop PCs anymore.</li>
                <li>Extending the local LLM voice assistants and whole-home speaker system to every single room</li>
                <li>Smart temperature and humidity control for each room</li>
              </ul>
