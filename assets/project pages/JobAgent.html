          <p>
            The Job-Agent was a small side-project built during the 2025 summer as part of my job search at the end 
            of my Master's. It is a self-hosted scraper agent pipeline capable of scraping dozens of websites autonomously. 
            Its goal is to inform me about new job postings from selected companies on a daily basis.<br>
            It features de-duplication through hashing, location- and type-filtering as well as building a database of seen jobs.
            The user is informed about new, relevant jobs found through Pushbullet on all devices.

              <p>
                After the daily activation, the Job-Agent scrapes all websites sequentially, saving job titles, locations, and other information.
                Due to a lot of job-sites being very JS-heavy and requiring advanced techniques, a headless web-browser is used to visualize the websites fully
                before extracting the data contained within.
                This information is hashed and the hash is compared to a continuously growing database of previously seen jobs. This de-duplication
                makes sure each job is only forwarded a single time (when it is first seen) even if it is persistent for multiple days.
                After this step, a filter for location and specific job-types such as full-time or engineering positions is applied.
                Finally, all newly found jobs are pushed to connected devices over pushbullet including a summary of how many new and total jobs are available.

            The creation of this Job-Agent has not only improved my understanding of websites and the tools required to navigate them
            programmatically, but has also saved me a lot of time during the job hunt. The estimated daily time saved could be well over
            half an hour each day over multiple months. Furthermore, it was an easy example of deploying continusouly
            running software on my homelab server. The project has also gained interest within my friends group and was shared multiple
            times for others to use as well.

            <p>
              In the future I plan to improve customizability for filtering different job fields, types and specific companies.
              Possibly I'll even add a UI on a webserver for easier configuration. Also, I want add to some data analytics to the UI 
              showing the number of jobs available throughout the year.
              Another idea is to filter all scraped jobs through an LLM interpreting the description and ranking/filtering them
              based on my skills. This will be added once I have a local LLM available in my homelab.
